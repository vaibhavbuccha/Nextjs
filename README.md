This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Routing summary

1. Page based routing mechanism - Pages are associated with a route based on their filename.
2. Nested Routes - Nested folder structure, files will be automatically routed in the same way in the URL.
3. Dynamic routes - Can be created by adding square brackets to a page menu.
4. catch all routes - Add three dots inside a square brackets to create a catch all route. Helpful when you want different URLs for the same page layout or even when you are working with pages where some of the route parameters are optional.
5. Link Component to navigate on click of an element.
6. useRouter hook's router.push method to navigate programmatically.
